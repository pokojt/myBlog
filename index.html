              <h1>RAIN</h1>
              <h3>2.21.2016</h3>
              <p>I&#39;ve always liked rainy days. Not the ones during which you have somewhere to be, and it&#39;s freezing rain in the middle of January and everyone hates everything. No, I like the soft, warm, spring rains that give everything such contrast. The shadows painted on my eyes stand out distinctly against the blindingly-pale winter skin on my cheekbones. The moisture on everything saturates the colors &ndash;	 the grass, the dark trees, the sidewalks and roads &ndash;	 while the overcast skies dull them. Colors are matte but vibrant. The rain rusts the metals we&#39;ve built and drowns our cemented paths, always reminding me that, while what we&#39;ve built is finite in both time and space, the rain has always existed here and always will. Nature prevails.</p>

              <p>I like the heavy, booming summer thunderstorms that somehow give us all a free pass to sit inside within a fortress of warm sheets, a book in one hand and a mug in short reach (come at me, clic&eacute;s). I like how the rain dims the lights indoors, allowing in just enough natural light from the cloudy sky. Everything looks more serene in that way.</p>

              <p>I like the smell that rain brings &ndash;	 that raw, dusty aroma of exposed earth and hot cement. I love the sounds of rain: the patter of raindrops on the ground, streets, roofs and windows, the crackling of the trees, the drumming thunder. I also like the echo of sounds after the storm, how everything seems so calmed and quiet that any sound cuts through the air like butter. Like the moisture has filled everything up and won&#39;t let a sound absorb into what&#39;s around it, sending it miles away from its source.</p>

              <p>And I like how rain changes people. We can feel the true force of nature. Sometimes the rain makes me playful, and I hop over puddles and feel the rain running on my skin, in my hair. But most of the time, the rain calms me. I grow more contemplative and allow myself to sink into a melancholic state of relaxation. I feel natural and nostalgic. It&#39;s a time when I can indulge feelings of sadness, and... isn&#39;t that so relieving? It reminds me of a quote from Doctor Who, when Sally Sparrow was asked,&quot;What&#39;s good about sad?&quot;</p>

              <p>&quot;It&#39;s happy for deep people.&quot;</p>
